Please feel free to use comenzi.txt as argument from CMD or set it up in visual studio so that it gets loaded with the program and take some commands we wrote or write your own

Else the program will automatically switch to keyboard mode for commands.

CREATE TABLE automatically has the functionality of IF NOT EXISTS (it will automatically check if a table already exists or not and will print the information on the console)


Have a nice day!
